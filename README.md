# Webhook Management Tool

This project aims to provide a webhook management tool that simplifies the process of managing and monitoring webhooks. It helps developers easily integrate webhooks into their applications and provides a user-friendly interface to manage webhook configurations and track their status.

## Features

- **Webhook Status Monitoring**: The tool allows users to view the status of their webhooks in real-time. They can see if the webhooks are successfully delivered, failed, or pending.

- **Webhook Configuration Management**: Users can easily configure and manage their webhooks through the tool's intuitive interface. They can add new webhooks, update existing ones, and delete unnecessary ones.

- **Error Handling and Notifications**: The tool provides comprehensive error handling and notifications. In case of failed webhook deliveries or any other issues, users receive timely notifications and can take appropriate actions.

- **Developer-Friendly Infrastructure**: Our goal is to abstract away the complexities of asynchronous event-based communication, enabling developers to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with infrastructure concerns.

The status of each webhook is displayed in real-time, allowing you to monitor the success or failure of webhook deliveries. In case of any issues, you will be notified through the tool's notification system.
